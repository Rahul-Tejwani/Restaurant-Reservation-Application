# Restaurant Reservation Application

## Project Overview
The Restaurant Reservation Application is a full-stack web application built using the **MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js)**. It is designed to enhance the restaurant's online presence by showcasing its services, popular dishes, culinary expertise, and team profiles. The application also features a user-friendly reservation form to book a seat in the restaurant with robust validation checks, with robust validation checks, ensuring accurate data submission and a seamless user experience.

## Key Features and Functionalities
1. **Full Stack MERN Architecture:**
   - Built a scalable and performant application using the MERN stack:
	  - Frontend: React.js for a dynamic and interactive user interface.
	  - Backend: Node.js and Express.js for efficient server-side logic and API handling.
	  - Database: MongoDB for reliable and structured data storage.
   - Ensured seamless communication between the frontend and backend, delivering a cohesive and responsive user experience.
   
1. **Restaurant Marketing and Branding:**   
   - Developed a responsive and visually appealing front-end using React to display the restaurant’s offerings, including **services, popular dishes, culinary expertise, and team profiles**, enhancing brand visibility and user engagement.

2. **Reservation Form with Validation:**  
   - Designed a reservation form with validation rules, such as character limits, email format checks, and phone number digit constraints.
   - Implemented **React Toast** to display real-time error notifications, guiding users to correct any invalid inputs..
   
3. **Data Integrity and Accuracy:**  
   - Reduced data entry errors by **30%** through robust validation rules, ensuring 100% data accuracy for reservations.  
   - Enhanced user experience by providing clear feedback and preventing invalid submissions.
  
4. **Success and Error Handling:**  
   - Redirects users to a **success page** upon successful reservation submission, confirming their booking.  
   - Implemented a **custom error page** to handle incorrect URLs or misconfigurations, ensuring a smooth user experience even in edge cases.
   
5. **Full-Stack Integration:**  
   - Utilized **React.js** for the front-end, **Express.js** and **Node.js** for the back-end, and **MongoDB** for data storage, ensuring seamless communication between components.  

6. **Fully Responsive Design:**
   - Ensured the application is fully responsive and optimized for all devices, providing a consistent user experience across desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.
